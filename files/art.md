## On Art and HTML5 Storage

I titled this talk __the art of HTML5 storage__ because after going back through technologies like Web Storage and Web SQL, and becoming familiar with new standards such as IndexedDB I could see a parallel with different types of art.

__NOTE:__ I quick to remind people I'm a not an expert at anything.  

_This is __especially__ true when it comes to art - I genuinely know nothing, so please take this analogy with a grain of salt ;)_

## Web Storage

The Web Storage API feels simple and accessible.  It is something that can generally be appreciated by all, even though some will turn their nose up at it.

---

## Web SQL

The Web SQL standard is something that some of use thought was a good idea at the time, but looking back is something that we know was a bit of a mistake.

## IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a new exploratory area which in it's current form is not going to be everyone's tastes.  I find myself looking at it's implementation in a similar way I feel confused by more progressive impressionist artists (such as [Picasso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso)) works.

Though I expect that more accessible implementations / wrappers will start to appear.

## In Summary

I'd generally recommend exploring the Web Storage API given its strong implementation across modern browsers, and look at how it can be used to improve the speed / usability of your applications and sites.

IndexedDB is something to keep an eye on, but requires broader browser support (which requires specification maturity) and some helpful wrapper libraries to make it genuinely appealing.
