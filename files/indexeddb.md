# IndexedDB

---

## Overview

The [Indexed Database API](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) is a great looking spec.  While it's still early days at the moment, the approach shows a lot of promise for working with larger client side datasets.

It is more complicated to work with than the Web Storage APIs (it's asynchronous for a start) but definitely not as painful as WebSQL.
